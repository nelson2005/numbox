def _stable_cfunc_alias(func, main_sig, jit_options=None):
    """Deterministic, process-stable LLVM symbol name for ``func``'s cfunc wrapper.

    numba mangles the wrapper name (``fndesc.llvm_cfunc_wrapper_name``) with a
    process-local unique-id abi-tag (``v<N>`` from ``FunctionIdentity.unique_id``,
    an ``itertools.count``). That tag is not part of the numba cache key, so two
    processes give the same function different wrapper names. Persisting a
    reference to that name — in this proxy, or in any ``cache=True`` caller that
    inlines the ``inline='always'`` proxy — lets concurrently-built caches pair a
    body object defining ``v<Na>`` with a caller referencing ``v<Nb>``, which
    aborts on load with ``LLVM ERROR: Symbol not found: cfunc...``. Referencing
    this deterministic alias instead (resolved per-process via
    ``llvmlite.binding.add_symbol``) keeps cached references valid
    across processes.

    The alias folds a body fingerprint alongside ``module + qualname + sig``:
    without it, two different bodies sharing one identity (factory-made
    same-qualname closures, in-process redefinition, or fork twins on a shared
    cache) collapse onto one alias, and the last-writer-wins ``add_symbol``
    silently rebinds callers to the wrong body. Folding the body gives each body
    its own alias. A consequence is that a body/signature change renames the
    alias, so a warm ``cache=True`` caller in another file (numba's cache key is
    callee-blind) references a symbol this process never registered. The load-time
    guard heals this automatically -- it discards that one cache entry and
    recompiles it, warning once with :class:`StaleProxyCacheWarning`; no manual
    cache clearing is needed (set ``NUMBOX_PROXY_CACHE_STRICT`` to raise
    :class:`StaleProxyCacheError` before the heal instead). The one variant that
    leaves the alias unchanged, an absent ``proxy_if_available`` binding, is
    covered by a diagnostic trap (see ``_register_absent_alias_trap``); the guard
    treats such an alias as stale too, so a warm caller reaches the same clean
    typing error a cold cache gives rather than the trap's swallowed-in-a-cfunc
    zero.

    The resolved ``jit_options`` are folded too. They govern the machine code
    ``njit(sig, **jit_options)`` emits, but appear nowhere in the identity above,
    so two decorations of one body differing only in a flag -- ``error_model``,
    ``fastmath``, ``boundscheck`` -- collapsed onto a single alias and
    last-writer-wins ``add_symbol`` sent every caller to whichever compiled last.
    That is silent and total: a caller of the ``numpy`` error-model binding ran
    the ``python`` one, so a division by zero returned 0.0 instead of inf with the
    exception swallowed at the cfunc boundary.

    The original function's variable will be bound to the proxy, i.e., calling the decorated
    function will call the proxy.

    The proxy is a JIT-compiled wrap that invokes the intrinsic that *declares* the `func`
    and calls it with the original arguments. Declaration instructions are relatively cheap
    to statically link into (potential) caller's LLVM code, which is the main motivation behind
    this decorator.

    Machine code for `func` can be cached when so specified in `jit_options`, in which case its
    JIT-compilation will load the `func` into the LLVM scope. Caching option is the other major
    motivation for this decorator, without the need to cache one can avoid static linking
    of the callee's LLVM code into the caller's by simply ignoring the former.

    In case when more than one signature is provided as the `sig` parameter, it is assumed
    that the first signature is the 'main' one while the other ones are supplied to
    allow for the `Omitted` types with default values for (some of) the parameters.

    A non-empty result means the payload must not be loaded. It is *every* stale alias the object imports,
    not the first -- an object that calls two edited proxies carries two unregistered names, and the caller
    joins the whole list into one warning, so the diagnostic never undercounts within an object. (What the
    guard cannot enumerate is stale entries never loaded: a proxied body whose own source changed recompiles
    fresh, overwriting its cache file, and is never handed to ``rebuild`` -- correctly drawing no warning.)
    ``ll.address_of_symbol`` is nearly an exact oracle: these names live only in llvmlite's explicit-symbol
    map, and because the alias encodes the body, signature and jit options, a resolving alias is normally the
    right body to call. The exception is an alias standing for an absent ``proxy_if_available`` binding, which
    resolves to a trap holding no body at all. Loading that object is worse than discarding it -- the trap's
    error is raised inside a ``@cfunc``, where numba swallows it and returns zero, so the caller silently
    computes on a wrong value, while discarding yields the same clean typing error a cold cache gives.

    The payload is unpacked inside the handler rather than by the caller, because its shape is precisely the
    thing a future numba might change.

    Under ``NUMBOX_PROXY_CACHE_STRICT`` a payload that cannot be *read* raises :class:`UnvalidatedProxyCacheError`
    instead of degrading to unchecked. A well-formed object the reader parses cleanly is not forced to raise
    even when it yields no stale alias: an object that carries the prefix only as a string constant parses
    exactly like one that carries it as an unresolved import would if the reader went blind, so there is no
    way to escalate the second without also aborting the first -- a healthy, entirely non-proxy cached
    function. Reader blindness is caught where it can be told apart, in CI, by a test that asserts the reader
    parses the objects numba actually emits; it is not guessed at here on live loads.
