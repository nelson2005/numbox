    ``.egg``, ``.whl`` or ``.pyz`` archive, which Spark's ``--py-files`` ships. For a ``.zip`` it takes the user's
    cache directory without checking at decoration that it can be written, and the first write raises ``OSError``
    instead. Either way the import died at the first decorated function, and nothing named the way out.

    turns caching off and silences the warning. An error that is not the cache's, as ``is_a_cache_error`` draws
    the line, is raised as it was.

    A ``.zip`` whose cache directory holds every entry but can no longer be written takes the fallback too, where
    numba alone would have loaded the entries: the writability check is the rule numba applies to every other
    placement, and the one the ``.zip`` locator is missing.

    Options without a ``cache`` key, as ``NUMBOX_JIT_OPTIONS`` can give, leave ``njit`` to its default, off, but
    the sqlite virtual-table and table-valued-function callbacks cache under them, so they are asked about too and
