    directory under the user's cache directory, each of the two under a cache directory named for the source's

    puts another locator first, ``NUMBA_CACHE_DIR`` is not offered. The error can name the
    location or a file numba writes in it. For a ``.zip`` or a frozen application, both cached under the user's cache
    directory, the location made writable:
    the ``.zip``'s error names it, a directory of numba's under the user's cache directory; the frozen
    application's is the no-locator one, numba having passed the location over on its error, so the user's
    cache directory is named. For any other archive, or a module without its source, the source files on disk
    or a ``.zip`` holding them. A ``.zip``'s location too long for the file system is the user's cache
    directory's doing, with the names numba makes bounded, and the remedy is that directory at a shorter
    path, through what moves it on the platform.

    files on disk: a package built on numbox that puts the question for its own files with

    ``longest_file_name`` for its own functions, ``LONGEST_CACHE_FILE_NAME`` being numbox's.

    """``options`` as given, or with ``cache`` off after one warning where numba can write no cache for numbox.

    numba sets a cached function up when it is decorated and raises ``RuntimeError`` there when no cache location
    can be written: a read-only install whose user cache directory cannot be written either, or an import from an
    ``.egg``, ``.whl`` or ``.pyz`` archive, which Spark's ``--py-files`` ships. For a ``.zip`` it takes the user's
    cache directory without checking at decoration that it can be written, and the first write raises ``OSError``
    instead. Either way the import died at the first decorated function, and nothing named the way out.

    Every function numbox caches decorates under the one ``jit_options``, so the question is put here, once, for
    a source file in each directory of the package that holds a module, and answered for the package. Where
    numba can cache no function of one of those files the options come back with ``cache`` off and one warning
    names the remedy: ``NUMBA_CACHE_DIR`` for a source file on disk, and where the location is too long for the
    file system what shortens the one it is, as ``cache_remedy`` sets out; for a ``.zip``, the user's cache
    directory made writable, since
    numba reads ``NUMBA_CACHE_DIR`` only for a source file on disk; for any other archive,
    or a ``.pyc``-only install, or a ``.pyc`` in a ``.zip``, the source files on disk or a ``.zip`` holding them,
    which numba 0.61 and later cache in the user's cache directory. ``NUMBOX_JIT_OPTIONS='{"cache": false}'``
    turns caching off and silences the warning. An error that is not the cache's, as ``is_a_cache_error`` draws
    the line, is raised as it was.

    A ``.zip`` whose cache directory holds every entry but can no longer be written takes the fallback too, where
    numba alone would have loaded the entries: the writability check is the rule numba applies to every other
    placement, and the one the ``.zip`` locator is missing, reported as https://github.com/numba/numba/issues/10888.

    Options without a ``cache`` key, as ``NUMBOX_JIT_OPTIONS`` can give, leave ``njit`` to its default, off, but
    the sqlite virtual-table and table-valued-function callbacks cache under them, so they are asked about too and

    ``UnvalidatedProxyCacheError`` instead of loading unchecked; and a detected stale alias raises
