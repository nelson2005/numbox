numbox.core.proxy
=================

Overview
++++++++

Implementation of :func:`numbox.core.proxy.proxy` decorator that swaps definition of a jit-compiled
function in-place for a declaration (while delegating the actual implementation
to a different function that is only accessible indirectly). As a result, statically linking in libraries
corresponding to proxy-jitted functions called from other jitted functions will
only paste a declaration rather than the entire LLVM IR code.

Cache-anchor mechanism
++++++++++++++++++++++

The ``@proxy`` decorator generates a thin wrapper function via ``exec()``.
For numba to cache that wrapper across processes, the wrapper's bytecode
needs a ``co_filename`` and ``co_firstlineno`` that point at real Python
source — both because numba's cache stamp uses ``(st_mtime, st_size)`` of
``co_filename`` for invalidation, and because
``inspect.getsourcelines(wrapper)`` gets called during numba's annotation
pipeline.

Anchoring at the user's file
----------------------------

The wrapper anchors at ``inspect.getfile(func)`` — the user's ``.py``
file where the ``@proxy`` decoration sits. Blank lines are prepended to
the generated wrapper source so the wrapper's ``@njit`` decorator
(which is what Python records as ``co_firstlineno`` for a decorated
function) lands at ``func.__code__.co_firstlineno`` — i.e. exactly the
line of the user's ``@proxy`` decorator. ``inspect.findsource(wrapper)``
then matches that ``@proxy`` line on its first check via
``r'^(\s*@)'`` — no backward scan needed, tokenization proceeds from
real, syntactically valid Python.

The hazard this avoids
----------------------

``inspect.findsource`` searches backward from ``co_firstlineno`` for any
line matching its pattern, *including* lines inside docstrings that
happen to start with ``@``. A docstring mentioning
``@njit(parallel=True) workers`` indented four spaces would be matched
as if it were a real decorator, and the C tokenizer would then read
``worker's`` (the apostrophe) as an unterminated string literal and
raise ``TokenError``. Related to CPython issue
`#122981 <https://github.com/python/cpython/issues/122981>`_.

Placing the wrapper's ``co_firstlineno`` directly at the user's
``@proxy`` line means ``findsource`` matches without scanning, and the
docstring contents are never re-tokenized.

Cache invalidation
------------------

For a file-backed cached ``@njit``, numba's source stamp is
``(os.stat(co_filename).st_mtime, st_size)`` — see
``numba.core.caching._SourceFileBackedLocatorMixin.get_source_stamp``.
Any edit to the user's file (the file containing the ``@proxy``
decoration) invalidates the wrapper's cache. Edits to ``proxy.py``'s
wrapper template itself — without a corresponding user-file edit — do
*not* invalidate the cache (the user file's mtime is unchanged); treat
wrapper-template changes as developer-managed. Clear the affected
entries — the ``.nbc`` / ``.nbi`` files in the ``__pycache__`` beside
each binding's source, or under ``NUMBA_CACHE_DIR`` — when shipping a
template change to numbox.

Alias content-addressing and cross-file callers
------------------------------------------------

``@proxy`` references the proxied body through a deterministic symbol alias
(``numbox_pxy_<name>_<hash>``) registered per process via
``llvmlite.binding.add_symbol``. The hash folds the body's content fingerprint
alongside ``module``, ``qualname`` and the signature, so two different bodies
that share one identity — factory-made same-qualname closures, an in-process
redefinition, or ``fork()`` twins on a shared cache — get distinct aliases
instead of colliding on one (a collision let the last ``add_symbol`` win and
silently rebound callers to the wrong body).

Separating them needs the fingerprint to see the captured value that differs, and
what it can see is bounded by what has an identity that means the same thing in
the next process. A ``numba.core.types.ExternalFunction`` and a ctypes pointer
reached by attribute access on a loaded library both do, and both are folded. A
ctypes pointer built from a raw address does not: two of them differ only by an
address that ASLR moves, so folding it would buy discrimination at the cost of the
process-stability the alias exists for.

Bodies in that last class are therefore allowed to collide, and the collision is
caught rather than hidden. The newcomer is published under a process-local name of
its own, so both bodies stay callable and correct in this process, and the shared
name is retired into the absent-alias set, so a warm caller of either one is
discarded and recompiled rather than served against whichever body happens to hold
the name today. Both lose cross-process caching, which is the price of a name that
does not identify what it names, and a
:class:`~numbox.core.proxy.proxy.AliasCollisionWarning` says so.

Reaching an alias twice is usually not a collision at all. The same body is
registered again whenever a module is reloaded or a factory is called twice with
equal arguments, and both registrations name the same code, so the alias is simply
re-pointed at the newly compiled address and nothing is retired. The two cases are
told apart by the values the fingerprint could not canonicalize: two bodies that
fingerprint alike are the same body except in those, so comparing them answers
whether one body was compiled twice or two bodies met on one name. That comparison
only has to hold inside the current process, which is why it may look at an address
where the fingerprint may not.

Because the alias encodes the body, changing a proxied binding's **signature or
body renames its alias**. numba's cache key for a *caller* is callee-blind, so a
``cache=True`` caller in another file cache-hits unchanged after such a change
and references the old alias, which the new process never registers. Left
unhandled this is a hard crash rather than a miss: RuntimeDyld resolves an
object's externals in one batch, so the single missing name zeroes *every*
relocation in the object and the process dies inside the argument-unpacking
wrapper — a bare segfault with an empty stderr, or, once any later cached object
is loaded, an ``LLVM ERROR: Symbol not found`` abort.

**numbox heals this on load; no manual cache clearing is needed.** Importing any
``@proxy`` binding imports numbox, which installs a guard around numba's cache
``rebuild``. Before a cached object reaches the execution engine its undefined
``numbox_pxy_*`` symbols are checked against the registered aliases; an object
referencing one this process never registered is discarded and recompiled in
place, emitting a :class:`~numbox.core.proxy.proxy.StaleProxyCacheWarning` that
names the retired alias. ``@njit``, ``@vectorize``, ``@guvectorize`` and
``@cfunc`` callers all heal.

Set ``NUMBOX_PROXY_CACHE_STRICT`` (truthy: anything other than unset / ``0`` /
``false`` / ``no`` / ``off``, case-insensitive) to make the guard fail loud
instead of healing: a stale alias then raises
:class:`~numbox.core.proxy.proxy.StaleProxyCacheError` *before* the discard,
leaving the stale entry on disk to inspect, and a payload the guard cannot read
raises :class:`~numbox.core.proxy.proxy.UnvalidatedProxyCacheError` rather than
loading unchecked.

**First run after an upgrade.** A numbox release that changes the alias
fingerprint renames every shipped alias at once, so the first process after the
upgrade heals every warm caller of a numbox binding — a one-time burst of
recompiles and warnings, after which the cache is warm again. To clear it by hand
instead, the entries are the ``.nbc`` / ``.nbi`` files in the ``__pycache__``
directory beside each caller's own source (or under ``NUMBA_CACHE_DIR`` if set);
``~/.cache/numba`` holds only callers numba cannot anchor to a source file.

The one variant that leaves the alias unchanged — a ``proxy_if_available``
binding present when the caller was cached but absent on reload — would otherwise
resolve to a diagnostic trap (a cfunc registered under the alias whose
``RuntimeError`` numba swallows at the C boundary, returning zero); the guard
treats such an alias as stale too, so the caller reaches the same clean typing
error a cold cache gives.

Multi-decorator support
-----------------------

When a user stacks decorators above ``@proxy(sig)``,
``func.__code__.co_firstlineno`` is the topmost decorator line (Python
records a decorated function's first line as its outermost decorator).
The anchor lands the wrapper at that topmost decorator.
``findsource`` matches it directly because every decorator line begins
with ``@``. Verified for single-, double-, and triple-stack outer
decorators.

``@proxy`` itself must be the innermost decorator (closest to ``def``).
A wrapping decorator between ``@proxy`` and ``def`` would hand
``@proxy`` a wrapped function whose ``__code__`` lives in the wrapping
decorator's source file, and would also break numba's ability to
JIT-compile through the intermediate Python wrapper.
